# Deploying App in 2-tier architecture on AWS

1. In the search bar, type `EC2` and select it.
2. Navigate to instances, then select **launch instances** on the right.
3. Input an appropriate name.

### --> app and OS image
1. Select **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type**.

### --> Instance Type
1. Make sure to select **t2.micro** for the instance type.

### --> Key Pair Login
1. Create a new key pair. 
2. Input the correct name.
3. Select create and you will download your `.pem` key. This is the equivalent of a **private key** on **Azure**.
### --> If previously created...
1. Use an existing key.

### --> Network Settings
1. Select **create security group**. *Remember, you need a **UNIQUE** security group for each VM.*
2. Allow **SSH** traffic for the **Database** EC2, allow **SSH** & **HTTP** for **App** EC2.
3. Create a new subnet. For the **Database**, make it **private**. For the **App**, make it **public**.
4. Edit IP for each one. Where in azure it was `10.0.1.0/24`, in AWS it is `172.31.1.0/24`. So you might want to use `172.31.2.0` for your **app**, and `172.31.3.0` for your **database**.

### --> Add Inbound Port Rules // Can be done after launch
1. Navigate to **Security Groups** under **Network and Security**.
2. Search for the NSG you wish to modify.
3. Select it.
4. Select **Edit inbound rules**.
5. For the DB EC2's inbound rules, you need to have a **Custom TCP** type rule with MongoDB's port range `27017`. You can select an NSG to only allow connections from THAT source. Better security.

### --> Advanced details
1. Locate user data and input the relative data for the **EC2**.

### --> Review
1. Review your details then launch instance.
